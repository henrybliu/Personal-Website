          , I undertook the task of converting an existing version of&nbsp;
          <a
            href=" https://neilbanas.com/projects/flowweaver/"
            target="_blank"

            FlowWeaver&nbsp;
          </a>
          to be accessible through web browsers. The original FlowWeaver was
          developed as a Java application with JavaFX, limiting its use to MacOS
          users. The goal of this project was to enhance accessibility, allowing
          oceanographers and K-12 educators, beyond the MacOS environment, to
          utilize this valuable tool for simulating ocean particle transport.
          The broader accessibility aims to contribute to increased awareness
          and understanding of ocean behavior and the impacts of pollution.

          As the lead developer, I played a central role in orchestrating
          discussions among the research team, K-12 educators, the UCSD IT
          department, and fellow student developers. This collaborative effort
          aimed to transform the vision of the research team into a tangible
          realityâ€”a tool that is easily accessible and beneficial to a wider
          audience.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginTop: "15px" }}>
          During my two months, I focused on the frontend of the application.
          Leveraging Mapbox, React, and JavaScript, I crafted an intuitive user
          interface capable of accurately simulating the flow of particles at
          chosen "drop points" under various simulation variables.
